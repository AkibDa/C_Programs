# C_Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs covering various concepts and algorithms.  It's designed to be a learning resource and showcase different programming techniques in C.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my C programs.  It includes examples of basic programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and more.  Whether you're a beginner learning C or looking for examples of specific implementations, you might find something useful here.

## About

This repository contains a collection of C programs that I've written to explore and learn various concepts in programming.  It's a personal project, and the programs range from simple examples of fundamental concepts (like "Hello, World!") to more complex implementations of data structures and algorithms.

I'm using this repository to:

*   **Improve my C programming skills:**  Working on these programs helps me solidify my understanding of the C language and its features.
*   **Learn about data structures and algorithms:**  Implementing these structures and algorithms from scratch is a great way to deepen my understanding of how they work.
*   **Create a resource for myself:**  This repository serves as a collection of working C code examples that I can refer back to in the future.
*   **(Optional) Share my learning progress:** I'm making this repository public so that others who are also learning C might find it helpful. If you find something useful or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contribute!

While some of the programs might be basic, the goal is to gradually add more sophisticated examples as I continue to learn.  I'm open to feedback and suggestions, so if you have any, please don't hesitate to reach out.  I hope this repository can be a useful resource for anyone learning C!

## Compilation

Most of the programs can be compiled using a C compiler like GCC.  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the program, and use the following command:

```bash
gcc <program_name>.c -o <program_name>
```
